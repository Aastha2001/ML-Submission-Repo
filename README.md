ML Mini Project on Titnic Survival Prediction

First of all, not all the data was given and had null values. This is the Data Preprocessing part.
So I filled the nulls with the mean values.
ie, Age, Embarked
The column values which can be used to decide the survival of passengers on the titanic were:
1) PClass
2) Age
3) Sex
4) Embarked

Next part is the Data Analysis and Model Working
Using Logistic regression, the predictions of the survival of the passengers given in test data can be made.
Last is the Final Output
The model works on the train data and predicts the output.
